I prepare `files/*.ldif` files. I referred to https://kdr2.com/tech/main/1812-export-and-restore-data-from-ads.html.
I ran ApacheDS in docker container and preconfigured using Apache Directory Studio.
After that, I exported it and sorted the ldif file using the perl script mentioned at https://kdr2.com/tech/main/1812-export-and-restore-data-from-ads.html.
